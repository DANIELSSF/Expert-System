# Automotive Diagnostic Expert System

This project introduces an Automotive Diagnostic Expert System based on rules utilizing the `experta` Python library. The goal is to provide a graphical interface using Tkinter where users input symptoms related to automotive issues, and the expert system can diagnose based on predefined rules.

## Necessary Installations

Before embarking on the creation of the graphical interface and the expert system, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. Use `pip` in your terminal or command prompt to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install tk
pip install experta
pip install pillow
```

These libraries are essential for working with the `Tkinter` graphical interface, implementing an expert system with `experta`, and handling images with `pillow`.
